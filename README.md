# Generator-asm

My own yeoman generator for ASMx86 projects based on my docker image

### Installation

You need to have node.js installed. Then you simply run
```
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-asm
```
and after you download half of internet you can create your first project from template simply by command
```

```
You can specify name of your project and witch template will you use(with bash scripts or .bat files).

### Remember that every change in your code you make in container stays in container
